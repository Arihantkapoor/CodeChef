- # Problem Statement: (Level Hard)
- Given an integer array A of size N. You have to merge all the elements of the array into one with the minimum possible cost.
- The rule for merging is as follows:
- Choose any two adjacent elements of the array with values say X and Y and merge them into a single element with value (X + Y) paying a total cost of (X + Y).
- Return the minimum possible cost of merging all elements.
