# 1 - Binary Distance
## Problem Statement
Chef is given two integers ***N*** and ***X***. He has been challenged to find 2 binary strings each of length ***N*** such that the hamming distance between the strings is exactly ***X***.

Hamming distance is the number of positions in which the two strings differ. Let ***cnt1*** denotes the number of **1**'s used in both strings combined and ***cnt0*** denotes the number of **0**'s used in both strings. Chef is also required to minimise ∣***cnt1*** − ***cnt0***∣.

Print any two binary strings satisfying the above conditions.
